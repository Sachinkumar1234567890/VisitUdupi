            </div>
            <div class="content2">
                <p>A fish fry is a meal containing battered or breaded fried fish. It usually also includes french fries, coleslaw, macaroni salad, lemon slices, tartar sauce, hot sauce, malt vinegar and dessert. Some Native American versions are cooked by coating fish with semolina and egg yolk.
    Fish is often served on Friday nights during Lent, the Christian season of repentance, as a restaurant special or through church fundraisers. A fish fry may include potato pancakes (with accompanying side dishes of sour cream or applesauce) and sliced caraway rye bread if served in a German restaurant or area.</p>

                <p>With the start of jackfruit season, don't we all crave for some delicious ponsa mulik? Yup. I do. I'm sure you do too. After we've had our share of ripe jackfruits from a jackfruit season, ie, we've had lots of & enough of ripe jackfruits & don't feel like eating them anymore, but there's still a surplus of ripe jackfruits coming in, and the season's glut has to be emptied, that's when we asked mom to make some delicious mulik, ponsa mulik for us. She sometimes made them happily for us herself, sometimes cribbed about the extra work involved, as we asked for them more often. :) Food does connect us with our memories in a wonderful way isn't it? </p>
