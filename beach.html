                <p>Mookambika Wild sanctuary has lot to offer and one such bliss is the Belkal Theertha; situated in the deep forests of Western Ghats, 50 kms away from Kundapura. The waterfall is also known as Govinda Theertha, which falls from a height of 300 feet from Korshi Betta; an extension of Kodachadri. The place has immense prominence in the Hindu religion as the water of the falls is believed to be sacred and people from various parts of the country come to take a holy dip in the water to wash away their sins and to get rid of their diseases. Kodachadri is the sacred place of Saraswathi the goddess of knowledge and since the water falls from the extension of Kodachadri the holiness of the water is considered equally important for the believers.
