                <p>The forests here are known to be home to a huge population of cobras and other rare species of tropical snakes. That is why it is also called the Cobra Capital of India. However, despite such a high number of poisonous snakes, the human-snake confrontation is very rare. Apart from King cobras, there are also other seasonal insects and worms like leeches, various kinds of beetles, earthworms, and more, which frequent the natural habitat in the monsoon.
                 The hill station of Agumbe has connections to modern Indian pop culture. Trivia is, that the fictional town in the show (and the eponymous novel by R.K. Narayan) is base popular TV series- Malgudi Days. The ‘Big House’ featured in the story is a real-life establishment and is believed to be 100-year-old.     </p>
