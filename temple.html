                <p>Dedicated to Lord Shiva, Ananteshwar Temple is an ancient 8th-century temple believed to be the oldest in the region. The temple complex also houses Chandramouleshwara and Krishna Temples. The main shrine is made of stone and has a recently installed silver door frame.Writer Roshen Dalal says, "According to texts, the city formed part of Parashurama Kshetra, the area is said to be claimed by Parashurama from the sea. Legends state that a king name Ramabhoja worshipped Shivalinga here in the form of Linga, which then manifests itself on a silver seat (rajata pitha). Thus in Sanskrit texts, the city is known as Rajata Pitha".There's also a belief that the temple was built by Pandavas
